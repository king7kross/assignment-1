This project contains two Python files:

calculator.py: A basic calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

in this task-1 i have used two variables with datatype float as division answers can results in decimals.
also here rather than creating different variables names for addition,subtraction,
i have used those initial variables num1 and num 2 inside the print function with separator(,)..


greeting.py: A simple program that takes a user's name as input and displays a personalized greeting message.

in this task-2 i have taken 2 variable names for firstname and lastname 
for the full name to be printed with a message i have used concatenation of strings
and the message was displayed with the help of strings and separator(,)
